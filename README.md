<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Baz</h1>

<p>
I'm a software engineer from Manchester, UK. I have a passion for tinkering with computers 
and code since I was a child! I have experience in building and maintaining distributed systems, 
cloud infrastructure, web and client applications with a variety of languages 
and technologies. I'm always looking to learn new things, meet new people and improve my skills!

Currently I am primarily using Golang⚡️, and recently started my journey with Rust🦀 on various projects
at work. I also have strong experience with JS🟨/TS🟦, Node🟢 as well as Python🐍. 

I'm a NeoVim user primarily developing via MacOS with containers 🐳
