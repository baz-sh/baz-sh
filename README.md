<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Baz</h1>

<p>
I'm a software engineer from Manchester, UK with a passion for tinkering with computers 
and code! I have experience in building and maintaining distributed systems, 
cloud infrastructure, web and client applications with a variety of languages 
and technologies. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills!

I have strong JS🟨/TS🟦 and Node🟢 background experience as well as Python🐍. More recently, I'm 
building with and developing a passion for Golang⚡️ and through work, I'm starting my journey with Rust🦀
