A short post on keyboard mappings!

One thing I find with programming is that the `US` keyboard layout is the most
common and most widely used, especially when you see all the mechanical keyboards etc.
However, I am from the UK and use a `UK` keyboard layout.

Over time I've wanted to switch to the US, so I have bought an external Apple keyboard
that is `US` layout, but I still use my MacBook Air a lot and it has a `UK` layout.
This can be a bit of a pain when switching between the two, especially when it comes
to the `ยง` symbol and the backtick symbol (**`**) .

I've managed to find a way to remap the keys on my Mac so that I can use the same
layout consistently, it works by flipping them around when required and flipping them
back when not. It gets a tad tricky when I'm using the Air keyboard as that's when
I need the map and when I'm using the external keyboard I need to remove the map,
as it's already the correct layout.

Next time I upgrade my Mac (which I'm waiting for the 2026 redesign)
I'll go straight to `US` layout, but for now this is a good workaround.

I've added the following to my `.zshrc` file to handle the remapping:

```zsh
key_map() {
  hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x700000035,"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x700000064},{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x700000064,"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x700000035}]}'
}

key_reset() {
  hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[]}'
}
```

What this does is when I'm using the Air keyboard I can run `key_map` to remap the keys
to my preferred layout, and when I'm using the external keyboard I can run `key_reset`
to reset the keys back to the default `US` layout (for that keyboard).

It's a bit fiddly, but it works for me in a sense that I can use a consistent layout
that I prefer and rely on muscle memory to hit the right keys.

A lot of what I find with computers is it's the little things. This might be a
bit much for some people to go through, and I understand that, but for me, it's worth
it. Plus you learn a bit along the way!

Happy coding!
