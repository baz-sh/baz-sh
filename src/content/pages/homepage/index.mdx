Hi, I'm Barry Hall, also known as Baz. I'm a software engineer with a passion for engineering,
AI, and distributed systems. I live in Manchester, UK, with my wife Holly and our son.

For over 20 years, I've been on a journey in software engineering.
I focus on developing and designing products and systems for the web and mobile.

As a hacker at heart and a tinkerer, I consider myself a generalist. I love exploring
new technologies and finding innovative solutions to complex problems. I have a
strong interest in AI and distributed systems, and I enjoy working on projects that
push the boundaries of what's possible.

I'm passionate about team culture and lean principles, aiming to deliver maximum business
value with minimal engineering effort in every project I undertake.

In my free time, I enjoy spending quality moments with my family and friends.

I'm an avid reader of non-fiction, stoicism, AI, and technology.

I'm always happy to connect and collaborate!
