Hi, I'm Barry Hall, also known as Baz. I'm a software engineer passionate about engineering, 
AI and distributed systems. I reside in Manchester, UK with my wife Holly and my son.

For over 20 years, I've been on a journey in the world of software engineering. 
I focus on developing and designing products and systems for the web and mobile.

A bit of a hacker at heart, most certainly a tinkerer, and specialist generalist, 
I love to explore new technologies and find innovative solutions to complex problems.
I have a strong interest in AI and distributed systems, and I enjoy working on projects that push
the boundaries of what's possible.

I'm passionate about team culture and lean principles, focusing on delivering the maximum 
business value for the least amount of engineering effort in any project I work on.

In my free time, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends.

I'm an avid reader of non fiction, stoicism, ai and technology. 

I'm always happy to connect and collaborate! ðŸ§¡
