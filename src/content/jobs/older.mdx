I only keep my three most recent jobs on my CV, as personally I feel these offer 
the most relevant experience for my current role. That said, I have worked in various 
engineering roles since 2002 in industries such as:

- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Logistics
- Legal
- Pharmaceuticals
- Marketing Agencies
