I have worked with various teams at Disney, including the Disney+ and Hulu teams,
as well as the internal tooling team focused on services and tools. My experience
includes developing CLI tools for builds, creating user interfaces for dashboards
and reporting, and building web services for authentication. I have also worked on
backend services to migrate to unified platforms and handled a bit of everything
in between.

Currently, I am a senior engineer on the Disney Streaming team, where I
leverage my frontend, backend, and infrastructure skills to add value. My role is diverse,
allowing me to contribute to many areas of the product, and I enjoy the challenge
of collaborating across the platform to help teams succeed. I work with a wide range
of technologies and fantastic people, and I appreciate the variety of challenges
and camaraderie that come with working on such a large platform, where everyone
motivates each other to excel.
