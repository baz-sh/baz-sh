Using the terminal today is almost essential, especially if you want to be fast and
efficient. My current shell of choice is ZSH (specifically; oh-my-zsh), which is
highly customizable and extensible. There are many plugins available that can
enhance your ZSH experience and boost your productivity and here are some useful ZSH
plugins that I find help maximize my terminal experience for not a lot of effort.

I am aware there are many other shells and plugins and would really like to try something
like Fish, but I'm too busy with other priorities right now. With that out the way, here are some
of my favorite ZSH plugins!

## Git

Comes by default with oh-my-zsh, it's a really great default!

```zsh
# Examples!
gst # git status
gaa # git add all
gc -m "foo!" # git commit with message
```

This really is a great plugin that provides a lot of useful aliases and functions for
working with Git. It simplifies many common tasks and makes it easier to work with
Git repositories directly from the terminal. See the full cheat sheet here:

## ZSH Autosuggestions

[ZSH Autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) does what it says on the tin.
It suggests commands as you type based on your command history and completions. This can
significantly speed up your workflow by reducing the amount of typing you need to do!

To complete, simply press the right arrow key to accept the suggestion, or continue typing to ignore it.

## ZSH Syntax Highlighting

[ZSH Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

Provides syntax highlighting for your command line input, making it easier to spot
errors and understand the structure of your commands. It highlights commands as you
type, which can help you catch mistakes before you run them.

For example, if you type a valid command, it will be highlighted in green, while an
invalid command will be highlighted in red. This visual feedback can help you avoid
common mistakes and improve your command line experience.

[!ZSH Syntax Highlighting Demo](./zsh-syntax.gif)

```zsh
# Example
echo "Hello, World!"      # This will be highlighted in green as it recognises echo as valid
ecchhhooo "Hello, World!" # This will be highlighted in red as it recognises "ecchhhooo" as invalid
```
